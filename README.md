User Stories
------------
I have developed these user stories from the rules of ten-pin bowling, having played a few dummy games:

```
As a human-bean
So that I can have fun
I want to play ten-pin bowling

As a player
So I can play
I want to roll a ball and get a score

As a player
When I roll less than ten-pins in a frame
I want to know my score at the end of a frame

As a player
When I roll a spare
I want to add my next score to this score

As a player
When I roll a strike
I want to add my next two scores to this score

```
